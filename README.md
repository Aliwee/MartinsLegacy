==========Update Note Apr. 8, 2018==========

Improved game interaction. And I found a problem in text font, it seems that most English text fonts don't support Chinese character, so I added one script which can change font for different languages.

Added an animation on Present scene.

==========Update Note Apr. 12, 2018==========

Added two images as character portraits.

Added two animations. BTW, it was a huge task for someone like me who didn't draw any frame animation images before. Glad that I made it finally.

Now brand new version of the first two levels have been completed. Yoho! 

==========Update Note Apr. 14, 2018==========

Improved animation of walking in the second level of chapter 1.

Added two new csv file for game texts. One is game characters description and another is game puzzles description. Thus updated ItemsInteractiveManager.cs, ItemsManager.cs and CheckItemsManager.cs.

Finished implementing a new level, cheers!
