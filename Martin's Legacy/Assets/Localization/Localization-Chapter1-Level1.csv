SAY.FungusFlow.26.,,\n\n致安德烈·芬恩\n\n我很遗憾，当你读到这封信的时候，疾病已将我带走。但请不要为此太过悲伤，我的学生。我曾经度过了快乐的一生。唯一令我担忧无比的，是我在鲁米诺的朋友们。他们并不知道我的离去。我恳请你沿着我曾经的走过的道路，找到在迷雾中的鲁米诺，帮助我那些充满疑惑和焦虑的朋友们。\n在格里姆小镇的收获日里，于森林小径上铺撒奶酪，追寻山羊人的踪迹，用钥匙打开尘封的铁门。你也许仍会一头雾水，请在那里找到来自埃隆的丹尼先生，他会向你解释一切。\n\n                               马丁·奥尼尔,"\n\nTo Andre Finn,\n\nWhen you read this letter, the disease has taken me away. But please don't be too sad for this, my students. I have lived a happy life. The only thing that worried me would be my friends at Luminor. They don't know about my leaving. I hope that you could find the Luminor in the fog along the path I once traveled to help my friends who are full of doubts and anxiety. \nOn the harvest day of Grim Town spread the cheese on the forest trail, trace the traces of the Goatman, and open the iron gate with the key. You may still be confused, then please find Sir Danny of Elon in Luminor, who will explain everything to you.\n\n                                 Martin O'Neill"
