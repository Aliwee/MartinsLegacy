SAY.FungusFlow.228.Character Name,,我无法看见你，我也无法听见你，时间回溯就像是观看了一段事先录制好的影像。,"I cannot hear or see you when creating this backtracking point. As you can imagine, time backtracking is just like watching a pre-recorded video."

SAY.FungusFlow.211.Character Name,,这是一盏路灯吗？但是它的形状像一只小虫子……,Is that a street lamp? But it's shaped like a little bug...
SAY.FungusFlow.214.Character Name,,在过去的时间点上，这盏灯发出了温暖的光芒。,"In the past time, the lamp gave a warm golden glow."
SAY.FungusFlow.217.Character Name,,看来已经很久没人在这里坐过了。,It seems that the bench has been abandoned for decades.
