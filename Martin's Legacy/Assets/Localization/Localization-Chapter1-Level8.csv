SAY.FungusFlow.214.安德烈,,你认识马丁？,Do You know Martin O'Neill?
SAY.FungusFlow.215.丹尼,,马丁在鲁米诺生活了30年，他是鲁米诺所有居民的朋友，包括我的主人在内。,"Yes. Martin had lived in Luminor for over 30 years. He was a friend of all residents of Luminor, including my master."
SAY.FungusFlow.216.丹尼,,他是闯入鲁米诺的第一个人类，起初我的主人对此十分不满。,"He was the first human to break into Luminor by chance, and at first, my master was very dissatisfied with it."
SAY.FungusFlow.217.丹尼,,马丁是个勇敢善良的人，他帮助并教导我们，带我们了解鲁米诺之外的世界。,But Martin was a brave and kind person who helped and taught us to learn the world outside Luminor.
SAY.FungusFlow.218.丹尼,,我的主人也逐渐改变了他最初的看法，他同意马丁在这里生活。,"My master had gradually changed his initial opinion, and he agreed that Martin could stay here."

SAY.FungusFlow.220.丹尼,,我想其他居民们会非常伤心的。,We all gonna be downcast towards the news.
SAY.FungusFlow.224.安德烈,,你提到了你的主人，他是鲁米诺的拥有者吗？,"You mentioned your master, is he the owner of Luminor?"
SAY.FungusFlow.225.丹尼,,是的，安德烈。他叫塞恩，他是一个神。,"Yes, Andre. He calls himself Thain, and he is actually an ancient god with great powers."
SAY.FungusFlow.226.安德烈,,他是一个神？,He is a god?
SAY.FungusFlow.227.丹尼,,是的，但是他的永生带给了他孤独。,"Aye, but his immortal brings the eternal loneliness in his soul."
SAY.FungusFlow.228.丹尼,,因此他创造了鲁米诺，又模仿地球生物的模样，创造了我和其他居民。,"So he created Luminor and created me, and other residents with similar appearances of creatures on the Earth."
SAY.FungusFlow.229.丹尼,,但他同时又是冷漠和易怒的，大多数时候他对我们不闻不问。,"But indifferent and irritable, most of the time he didn't care about us."
SAY.FungusFlow.230.丹尼,,我认为很多居民实际上害怕他。,Many of us were actually afraid of him.
SAY.FungusFlow.285.丹尼,,他的化身之一是山羊，在人类的世界，你们似乎称呼他为“山羊人”。,"One of his incarnations takes after a goat. In your world, people seem to call him a ""Goatman."""
SAY.FungusFlow.286.丹尼,,的确，我在森林入口处看见了山羊人，那就是塞恩？,"Indeed, I saw a goatlike man at the entrance to the forest, that's him?"
SAY.FungusFlow.287.丹尼,,实际上，那不是塞恩，我的主人至今仍未离开过鲁米诺。,"In fact, that wasn't Thain, my master still hasn't left Luminor yet. "
SAY.FungusFlow.288.丹尼,,塞恩创造了一群胆小的土拨鼠，但他们能变幻成强大生物的模样，以保护自己。,"Thain created a group of timid marmots, which can change appearances into something frightening and powerful to protect themselves."

SAY.FungusFlow.297.丹尼,,时间回溯点。这个木杖被塞恩赋予了魔法。,A place where you can go back to a particular past in timeline. This staff was given magical power by Thain.
SAY.FungusFlow.296.安德烈,,它能带我回到过去？,So you're saying that it could take me back to the past?
SAY.FungusFlow.299.丹尼,,是的，安德烈。在时间回溯点处，用这个木杖敲地三次，你就能回到过去。,"Aye, my friend. Knock the ground three times with the staff at the backtracking point, and you'll be sent to an expected past, which the creator of that backtracking point wanted you to see."
SAY.FungusFlow.300.安德烈,,这真是难以置信……我一直以为只有电影或者小说里面才会有这种事情。,That's incredible... I always thought that it would only happen in movies or novels.
