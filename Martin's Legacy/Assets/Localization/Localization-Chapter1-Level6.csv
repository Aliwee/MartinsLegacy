SAY.FungusFlow.142.安德烈,,阳光令森林更加美丽了。,"The sunshine, with no doubt, makes the forest even more beautiful."
SAY.FungusFlow.214.安德烈,,你认识马丁？,Do You know Martin O'Neill?
SAY.FungusFlow.215.丹尼,,马丁在鲁米诺生活了30年，他是鲁米诺所有居民的朋友，包括我的主人在内。,"Yes. Martin had lived in Luminor for over 30 years. He was a friend of all residents of Luminor, including my master."
SAY.FungusFlow.216.丹尼,,他是闯入鲁米诺的第一个人类，起初我的主人对此十分不满。,"He was the first human to break into Luminor by chance, and at first, my master was very dissatisfied with it."
SAY.FungusFlow.217.丹尼,,马丁是一个勇敢善良的人，他帮助并教导我们，带我们了解鲁米诺之外的世界。,But Martin was a brave and kind person who helped and taught us to learn the world outside Luminor.
SAY.FungusFlow.218.丹尼,,我的主人也逐渐改变了他最初的看法，他同意马丁在这里生活。,"My master had gradually changed his initial opinion, and he agreed that Martin could stay here."
SAY.FungusFlow.219.丹尼,,他的离去对我们来说是一个巨大的损失。,His departure is a tremendous loss for us.
SAY.FungusFlow.220.丹尼,,我想其他居民们会非常伤心的。,We all gonna be downcast towards the news.
SAY.FungusFlow.224.安德烈,,你提到了你的主人，他是鲁米诺的拥有者吗？,"You mentioned your master, is he the owner of Luminor?"
SAY.FungusFlow.225.丹尼,,是的，安德烈。他叫塞恩，他是一个神。,"Yes, Andre. He calls himself Thain, and he is actually an ancient god with great powers."
SAY.FungusFlow.226.安德烈,,他是一个神？,He is a god?
SAY.FungusFlow.227.丹尼,,是的，但是他的永生带给了他孤独。,"Aye, but his immortal brings the eternal loneliness in his soul."
SAY.FungusFlow.228.丹尼,,因此他创造了鲁米诺，又模仿地球生物的模样，创造了我和其他居民。,"So he created Luminor and created me, and other residents with similar appearances of creatures on the Earth."
SAY.FungusFlow.229.丹尼,,但他同时又是冷漠和易怒的，大多数时候他对我们不闻不问。,"But indifferent and irritable, most of the time he didn't care about us."
SAY.FungusFlow.230.丹尼,,我认为很多居民实际上害怕他。,Many of us were actually afraid of him.
SAY.FungusFlow.282.丹尼,,他的化身之一是山羊，在人类的世界，你们似乎称呼他为“山羊人”。,"One of his incarnations takes after a goat. In your world, people seem to call him a ""Goatman."""
SAY.FungusFlow.283.安德烈,,的确，我在森林入口处看见了山羊人，那就是塞恩？,"Indeed, I saw a goatlike man at the entrance to the forest, that's him?"
SAY.FungusFlow.284.丹尼,,实际上，那不是塞恩，我的主人至今仍未离开过鲁米诺。,"In fact, that wasn't Thain, my master still hasn't left Luminor yet. "
SAY.FungusFlow.285.丹尼,,塞恩创造了一群胆小的土拨鼠，但他们能变幻成强大生物的模样，以保护自己。,"Thain created a group of timid marmots, which can change appearances into something frightening and powerful to protect themselves."
SAY.FungusFlow.286.丹尼,,当格里姆小镇有收获日的时候，他们总是喜欢变成塞恩的模样，去偷吃一些美食。,"When Grim Town celebrates the Harvest Day, they prefer to camouflage themselves, disguise as Thain, to steal some food."
SAY.FungusFlow.287.安德烈,,鲁米诺的动物居民们真是神奇啊。,"Wow, that's amazing."
SAY.FungusFlow.233.安德烈,,这是一只鹿吗？它的毛色很漂亮。,Is that a deer? Its color is pretty attractive.
SAY.FungusFlow.234.丹尼,,感谢你的赞美，先生。,"Thank you for your compliment, sir."
SAY.FungusFlow.235.安德烈,,等等，是谁在说话？难道是……,"Wait, who is talking to me? Is it..."
SAY.FungusFlow.236.丹尼,,如你所见，先生，我会讲人类的语言。,"As you can see and hear, sir, I am capable of speaking the language of mankind."
SAY.FungusFlow.237.安德烈,,天呐！可是你是一只鹿啊！,"How's that even possible! I mean, you're just a deer!"
SAY.FungusFlow.238.丹尼,,主人在创造我的时候，的确赋予了我鹿的外表。,"When my master created me, he did give me the appearance of a deer."
SAY.FungusFlow.239.丹尼,,但是他还让我有了和他一样的智慧，语言是我所习得知识的一部分。,"But I was also blessed with the same wisdom as him, and diverse languages are part of what I've learned."
SAY.FungusFlow.240.安德烈,,这简直难以置信。不过也许这是这地方的神奇之处。,It's kind of unbelievable. But maybe it's what makes the magic of this place.
SAY.FungusFlow.265.丹尼,,你好，鲁米诺之外的来客，我是来自埃隆的丹尼。,"Morning, dear visitor from the outside, I'm Danny of Elon, from the southern region in Luminor."
SAY.FungusFlow.241.安德烈,,你好……我叫安德烈·芬恩。我能叫你丹尼吗？,Morning... I'm Andre Finn. Can I call you Danny?
SAY.FungusFlow.242.丹尼,,当然，不过我得请你说明进入鲁米诺的目的。,"Sure, but I have to ask you to state your purpose of entering Luminor."
SAY.FungusFlow.243.丹尼,,我的主人对陌生的来客一向抱有敌意。,My master has always been hostile to strangers.
SAY.FungusFlow.244.安德烈,,我的老师马丁·奥尼尔给了我一封信，它让我来鲁米诺找你。,"A teacher and friend of mine, Martin O'Neill, wanted me to come here and find you."
SAY.FungusFlow.245.丹尼,,马丁？他还好吗？他已经离开鲁米诺7年了。,Martin? How's he going these days? He has left Luminor for 7 years.
SAY.FungusFlow.246.安德烈,,我很抱歉，但马丁在不久前因病去世了。,"I'm sorry, but Mr. O'Neill died of illness not long ago."

SAY.FungusFlow.257.丹尼,,鲁米诺失去了马丁之后，萧瑟破败了许多。,The mood went somber and bleak. Luminor has once again become forgotten and isolated.
SAY.FungusFlow.258.丹尼,,还有很多像我一样的居民们，对马丁逝世的消息一无所知。,There're still many dwellers who know zero about the news of Martin's death.
SAY.FungusFlow.293.丹尼,,他们在这7年间一直处于消极的状态。,They've been in a sorrowful and downcast state for the past 7 years.

SAY.FungusFlow.260.安德烈,,我想我可以试试看。,"Okay, I guess I can give it a try."

SAY.FungusFlow.262.丹尼,,他离开之前，留下了在这里使用的木杖。,"Before he departed, Martin left his staff here. I believe it's still in the cabin."
